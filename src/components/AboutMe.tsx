                    Currently most of my time I am spending on boardering my
                    knowleadge of Front-End Development. I am learning how to
                    create responsive websites and applications. At the begining
                    I started with python. Next I went throught Html, CSS and
                    JavaScript courses and varoius documentations. I meet also
                    the SASS, Node.js and Boostrap. After that I went thorught
                    React and TypeScript. It has open my eyed how clean and
                    composable the code can be. All projects I am working on are
                    stored using GIT commands.
                    <br /> Let check some examples of{" "}

                    I am aware that I am on the begining and there is a lot of
                    hard work in front of me but I am determined and 100%
                    oriented on this kind of job. <br />A various challenges
                    requiring logical thinking were always my scope of
                    interesting. Solving programming tasks makes me satisfied
                    and I very like it. Give me a chance and I promise I will do
                    my best to not let you down.
