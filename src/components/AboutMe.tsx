                    I live in the Silesian Voivodeship in Poland. I graduated
                    from the Silesian University of Technology, and for the past
                    7 years, I have been working as a{" "}

                    Currently, most of my time is spent broadening my knowledge
                    of Front-End Development. I am learning how to create
                    responsive websites and applications. In the beginning, I
                    started with Python. Next, I went through HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript courses, as well as various documentations. I
                    also got acquainted with SASS and Bootstrap. After that, I
                    delved into React and TypeScript. It has opened my eyes to
                    how clean and composable the code can be. Curently I've
                    started expand my knowledge towards Node.js/Express.js and
                    REST API. All the projects I work on are stored using GIT
                    commands.
                    <br /> Let check some examples of{" "}

                    I am aware that I am at the beginning, and there is a lot of
                    hard work ahead of me, but I am determined and 100% focused
                    on this type of job. Various challenges requiring logical
                    thinking have always been within my scope of interest.
                    Solving programming tasks makes me satisfied, and I really
                    enjoy it. Give me a chance, and I promise I will do my best
                    not to let you down.
